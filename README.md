**epid2dose** is an open-source deep learning framework for predicting two-dimensional **Portal Dose (PD)** distributions directly from transit **Electronic Portal Imaging Device (EPID)** images.

The software implements the inference pipeline described in:

> **Marini L. et al.** *Improving patient treatment accuracy using transit dosimetry with Electronic Portal Imaging Device images and deep learning*. Physics and Imaging in Radiation Oncology, 39, 100966 (2026).

---

## Overview

Conventional EPID-based dosimetry requires multiple detector-specific calibration and correction procedures before estimating the corresponding Portal Dose distribution.

**epid2dose** replaces this workflow with a single deep learning model that directly predicts the Portal Dose from the measured transit EPID image.

The package provides:

- automatic EPID preprocessing;
- Portal Dose prediction using an ensemble of trained U-Net models;
- optional gamma-index validation against reference Portal Dose distributions;
- automatic PDF report generation.

# Installation

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lorenzomarini96/epid2dose.git

cd epid2dose
```

Create a virtual environment (recommended)

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate it

Linux / macOS

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Windows

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install the required packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Download trained weights

The trained network weights are distributed separately because they exceed GitHub file size limits.

Download the weights from:

**[(link here)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kV3Vw6ueXHsnLeENCj65CruUSFxBfPMC?usp=drive_link)**

and extract them inside

```text
models/weights/
```

The expected folder structure is

```text
models/
└── weights/
    └── cv_1/
        ├── model_1/
        ├── model_2/
        ├── model_3/
        ├── model_4/
        └── model_5/
```

# Example dataset

The repository contains a small example dataset:

```text
examples/
├── input/
│     EPID DICOM images
│
├── reference/
│     Portal Dose reference (.txt)
│
└── output/
```

---

# Running inference

Predict Portal Dose images

```bash
python pd_prediction.py \
-i examples/input \
-o examples/output
```

To additionally generate a gamma-index validation report

```bash
python pd_prediction.py \
-i examples/input \
-o examples/output \
--reference_dir examples/reference \
--report
```

---

# Output

The software automatically creates

```text

│     PD_*.npy
│
└── reports/
      prediction_overview.pdf
      validation_report.pdf
```

# Prediction overview

The generated prediction report contains the input EPID image together with the corresponding predicted Portal Dose.

---

# Validation report

If reference Portal Dose distributions are available, the software automatically computes gamma-index analysis and generates a validation report.

The report includes

- reference Portal Dose;
- predicted Portal Dose;
- gamma-index histogram;
- gamma passing rates.
